<h1>Hello!</h1>
<div class="about">
	<p>My name is Flora. I'm a Pythonista and (reluctant) JavaScript enthusiast, who also tinkers in Ruby and Obj-C/iOS. I'm a web developer in the making--a FutureDev--and I enjoy helping to organize groups that do fun things with computers.</p>
	<p>I've always been pretty nerdy, but I wasn't always a computer nerd.</p>
	<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> In my former life I was a humanities nerd, studying Rhetoric in the Cultural Studies PhD track at the University of London. There, I spent most of my time researching and writing about postcolonial reason and jurisprudence, ethics, and contemporary media texts and practices. I absolutely loved the community that I was a part of and was passionate about the work I was producing, for which I was recognized by the Centre (for Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths).</p>
	<p>But in 2008 the ground shifted as the economy slid into recession, and an already tight academic job market began to suffer a squeeze unlike anything I'd ever seen. I had just finished the MA portion of my program, and knew that I had to make a decision about whether to continue or move on to something else.  I took some time and came to the following conclusions: I'm not willing to roll the dice on a 14% lifetime tenure-track placement rate for humanities graduates; I want to have a say in were I live; and I don't want to give up the chance to have a family of my own (an unspoken near-rule for female academics).</p>
	<p>So I left to pursue life as a grad-school dropout :)</p>
	<p>In my infinite wisdom (ahem) I chose to follow my dad's advice--he's a data systems engineer at a major Seattle hospital--and go into computers. Never mind that my knowledge of computing at the time was limited to email, web-based research, and using Word...I didn't, frankly, have a better idea and wasn't going to let my ignorance get in the way!</p>
	<p>Not particularly keen on going back to school, I found a one-year certificate program in multimedia at Portland State University and set off on what I thought would be a fast-track to becoming a Web Designer. It was a great experience: I had excellent instructors, culled from talented local agencies; I made new friends, many of whom I continue to collaborate with; and I learned a lot about mobile development, UX design, HTML5/CSS3, digital strategies, and various design programs and methodologies.</p>
	<p>However, my lightbulb-goes-off-in-head, "I love this" moment didn't come in "Advanced CSS" or "Principles and Practices of Design." In fact, it didn't come until the very end of the program, when I realized mid-mobile-web-app that I <em>really enjoy</em> programming in JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
	<p>Design, no; programming, yes. Kchwwww! Mind blown.</p>
	<p>Around that time I also took part in the first Python Weekend Workshop, which I had learned about by reading, "<a title="Where the Tech is She?" href="http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-19236-where_the_tech_is_sh.html">Where the Tech is She?</a>," a cover story that ran in the Willamette Week (Ruth Brown, 05/23/2012) about the dearth of women engineers in tech jobs. Modeled after the <a title="Boston Python Workshop for women" href="http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/">Boston Python Workshop</a>, the event was orchestrated by Michelle Rowley, organizer of the <a title="Portland Python User Group meetup site" href="http://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/">Portland Python User Group and monthly Hack Nights</a> (and now, founder of <a title="Code Scouts" href="http://www.codescouts.org">Code Scouts</a>). I had such a good time that I started attending these local events, and even picked up some Ruby/Rails knowledge in the first <a title="Portland Rails Girls workshop" href="http://railsgirls.com/portland">Portland Rails Girls</a> workshop.</p>
	<p>Long story short: I was hooked...and I've been happily hacking away ever since on my way to being an actual, fully realized, white-board-slaying web developer (though don't take this too literally--the "white board interview" continues to be the subject of many a nightmare).</p>
	<p>I've also become involved in trying to give back to the local community and help my fellow future devs by co-organizing the Portland chapter of PyLadies, an international organization focused on realizing gender-parity in the Python community (<a title="Portland PyLadies meetup site" href=" http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-PDX/">PyLadies PDX</a>, <a title="PyLadies Int'l website" href="http://www.pyladies.com">PyLadies Int'l</a>). At latest count, we've got nearly 100 members, and we run two skills-building workshops a month and have a continuous calendar of extra-curricular course-taking and projects that happen on weekly Saturday Hack Days.</p>
	<p><strong>Someday soon I will put a strike through the "future" part, but for now.....</strong></p>
	<p>Being a future dev means a lot of things--entering a new world that is both tremendously exciting and really, really scary; often not knowing where to start; failing, failing, failing, and then failing again; and spending more time on Google than anyone probably should. As a future dev, you'll do way too many tutorials and will end up with enough 'badges' to put the local Girl Scout troop to shame. You'll probably take a course, or two, or five, on Coursera or iTunesU or EdX, of which maybe half you'll actually see all the way through. You'll wonder what the heck to do next, how to take the training wheels off and really get going on a real project.</p>
	<p>With any luck you'll look around you and see that there are others out there who are right where you are, as well as others who are more experienced and who are willing to lend you their time to get you through those 'I'm stuck' moments. I can't understate what it has meant to me to be involved in PyLadies, where I get to learn from a ridiculously inspiring Organizer and mentor in Selena Deckelmann (<a title="Selena Deckelmann's home page" href="http://chesnok.com">chesnok.com</a>), and where I also get to benefit from the collective intelligence of a group of singularly bright and interesting women.</p>
	<p>If you're industrious, you too will find a way to get involved with a group of people who are willing to make the commitment to help each other regularly, and in a dedicated 'safe' space for beginners. [See the "Resources" section for a list of groups that may be operative in your area, and for opportunities to connect online for those who don't have a tech community nearby to connect with]. You may even choose to get involved as an organizer and peer-mentor like I did, or start your own group altogether!</p>
	<p>No matter what your specific itinerary, to make the transition from 'future dev' to 'dev' you'll put in a lot of hard work and many long hours. I know I do. But repeat this in your head, as I do often: It will pay off. It will pay off in ways that will confound *spectacularly* that nagging voice inside that says, "I can't do this." It will pay off when you reach that goal, whatever it is--learn to make a website, start a blog, become a professional developer, launch a start-up--that you set out for yourself. We can do this!</p>
	<p><strong>The blog</strong></p>
	<p>Showing one's 'newbieness' is probably the scariest part about entering the tech world. I wanted to start a blog months ago, but I'm only just learning to get over the part of me that has too much pride to make mistakes in front of others. I'm undoubtedly going to make mistakes here--that's just a part of being new, and of being human. But I also recognize that the progress I've made is due, in large measure, to other newbies who have been courageous enough to share their experiences and insights. I hope that in some small way, I can offer the same boost to other future devs out there.</p>
	<p>If you are a more seasoned developer acting in mentorship capacity to beginners, I have a special section that I'm developing for you. This will contain experiences that have inspired and frustrated, tips for avoiding the latter, as well as advice based on what's working for us in PyLadies. One of the ways I am able to contribute to our curriculum is to help direct it to cover areas that seasoned developers often take for granted. Even the most conscientious of mentors forgets what it is like to be unfamiliar with certain basic terms, processes and environments. Drop me a line if you have any feedback, questions, or requests--I'm always happy to meet and discuss with other organizers about what works/doesn't.</p>
	<p>Finally, I am working on a series of beginner-focused 'how tos' to help people get going with IRC, Git, and the command line, and I'm keeping track of resources and favorites as they are being discovered by the groups I'm involved in. If you have anything to add, don't hesitate to share!</p>
