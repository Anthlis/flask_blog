title: Starting a Blog, Preparing for Pycon

summary: Phew! It has taken me way too long to officially start this blog. To be honest, between trying to gain fluency in computer science, trying to pick up programming, working on periodic front-end projects, co-organizing PyLadies PDX, and working as a community organizer for Code Scouts, I don't know when I'm going to have the time to blog. I should ask in advance for your forgiveness--these pages will undoubtedly contain typos, glaring omissions, and the inevitable error here and there. Particularly anything I write in the near future, because I'm trying to prepare myself for MY FIRST PYCON!!!!


Phew! It has taken me way too long to officially start this blog. To be honest, between trying to gain fluency in computer science, trying to pick up programming, working on periodic front-end projects, co-organizing PyLadies PDX, and working as a community organizer for Code Scouts, I don't know when I'm going to have the time to blog. I should ask in advance for your forgiveness--these pages will undoubtedly contain typos, glaring omissions, and the inevitable error here and there.



Particularly anything I write in the near future, because I'm trying to prepare myself for MY FIRST PYCON!!!! --and things are getting a little hectic around here. There's ordering stickers and shirts so the 8--that's right, 8--PyLadies from Portland who are attending PyCon can properly represent. Then there's circulating phone lists throughout both local and international PyLadies circles so we can all communicate while we're down in Santa Clara, and making sure that I coordinate my volunteering with the rest of my schedule and with everyone elses'. Next is all of the printing and downloading of tickets--for PyCon, for the opening party, for the sponsored tutorials I'm hoping to attend, for the PyLadies lunch and the Pyladies auction, for the closing party. I also had to add some extra nights because I decided to stay for part of the sprints week, and my old suitcase died and I had to shop for another...am I forgetting anything?

Ah, yes, preparing my actual coding skills for optimal PyCon participation (optimal being relative to my Junior Dev level).

In order to prepare myself I've done two things: first, I worked with Selena (Deckelmann) to put my two cents in on a project that she started and that we are going to continue to develop. The project uses Twitter as a conduit to pull RSS feeds from all of your friends and followers for reading in Google Reader, or your chosen app. I came into the project after Selena had already built some of the core code, and essentially spent a day reading her code over and over trying to make sense of it--my first time reading through a substantial body of object-oriented programming. When I felt I understood what was going on, I took the instructions I was given--add functions to get tweets from a user's timeline; search those tweets for feeds--wrote up some code I thought seemed plausible, and issued a pull request. Apparently all that initial reading of Selena's code paid off because she merged my commits and said that my code was "perfect". It's two functions--a small victory--but don't mind if I go ahead and dust my shoulders off anyway. (This was following a rather big javascript fail, so it was much needed).

The second thing that I am doing is going through a tutorial offered by Runestone Interactive called, "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures" (interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds). I'm about halfway through it with just 5 days before I leave, but it's been such a great refresher so far (after a 1 1/2 month period of front-end heaviness) that I'm going to try to power through in the next few days.
